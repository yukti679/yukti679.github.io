        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>Hi! My Name is Yukti Avala and I am a junior at Holliston High School. 
            In my free time I love to read books, spend time with my friends, play tennis,
            draw, and watch Netflix. Click on the Show Recs tab to see some of my favorite shows!
            Click on the Aspirations tab to see what I want to do in the future and click on the Experience tab
            to see where I have worked and volunteered.
