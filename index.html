                I am a member of DECA, a business and marketing club that prepares students for careers in marketing, finance, hospitality, and management.
                In DECA, I have had the opportunity to participate in the Business Law and Ethics Team Decision Making event and the Business Finance Series individuals event.
                As a national level qualifier, some of the competitions I have participated in include the DECA State Competition (SCDC) and the DECA International Career Development Conference (ICDC).
                I also took part in the Quizbowl competition at SCDC in 2024. Through these competitions, I have learned how to analyze business scenarios, develop marketing strategies, and present my ideas effectively.
                I also hold a leadership position in my school's chapter, where I help organize events and mentor over 150 members.
